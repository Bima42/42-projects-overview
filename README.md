# 42-projects-overview
This repository contains a list of all the projects I have done at 42 Lausanne.

## **Program Overview**
<img src="resources/organization_chart.png" alt="organization_chart"/>

The 42 School program is structured around a central project, `libft`, which serves as the entry point for students. 
It's designed to progressively unlock more advanced projects, organized into concentric circles that represent different levels of achievement and complexity.

- Blue circle are **validated projects**.
- White circle are **accessible projects**.
- Grey circle are **locked projects**.

## **How It Works**
##### **Starting Point:**
- The journey begins with the `libft` project located at the center of the chart.
- Successfully completing libft unlocks access to the first circle of projects.

##### **Progression Through Circles:**
- Each circle represents a new level of projects that must be completed before moving on to the next.
- Projects in the inner circles are prerequisites for those in the outer circles.
- Students must validate (complete and pass) each project within a circle to progress to the next one.

##### **Common Core:**
- The common core is completed when **all projects in all circles have been validated.**
- This marks the end of the core curriculum and the beginning of specialization options.

##### **Specialization:**
- After finishing the common core, students can choose from various specialized tracks based on their interests and career goals.
